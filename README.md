This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid routing protocol in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) utilizing Neural Networks to optimize routing decisions in dynamic vehicular environments. The project leverages both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict optimal routes based on real-time network conditions, vehicle mobility patterns, and traffic data.
